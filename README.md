This is a web application written in Rust for cross checking reference numerals in patent figures with reference numerals in the written description. The reference numerals are extracted from the patent figures using fine-tuned versions of the OCRS models and OCR engine by Robert Knight. See https://github.com/robertknight/ocrs-models and https://github.com/robertknight/ocrs.
